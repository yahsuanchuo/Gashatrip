# Gashatrip - A travel guide app developement project 

#### This is a 4-memeber team project of developing an APP from creating ideas to launching on APP store

##### When arriving somewhere unfamiliar, are you curious about delicious food to eat and interesting places to visit? GashaTrip is a virtual capsule toy machine in your smartphone, giving you three randomly selected Gashapons that you can pick one as a recommendation of surprising place to visit. Our vision is to establish a platform where users can customize their machines and fill their own Gashapons with information that can be helpful to know what can be done for uncertain situations.
